  {
    question: "Why are the whales connected to cryptocurrency?",
    answer: `Many of us got into crypto first and then into NFTs following that, 
      so it's tying the two primary passions together. It also gives holders the opportunity 
      to identify with their favorite coin / token in the form of a whale, which is slang for a large asset holder.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How many attributes will there be?",
    answer: `Whales are procedurally generated from 150+ hand drawn traits resulting in millions 
      of potential unique combinations. Each Whale will represent one of 20 different crypto 
      coins / tokens and their color will correspond with its logoâ€™s colors.`,

      generations of whales made available as the project and community grows.`,

  {
    question: "What will the price be to mint a whale?",
    answer: `Whales will cost 0.06 ETH to Mint with NO bonding curve or FOMO pricing.

      to the project-promoting the project w/out spamming, positive discord engagement, retweeting etc.`,
