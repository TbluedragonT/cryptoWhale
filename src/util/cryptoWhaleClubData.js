      "A collection of 10,000 unique Crypto Whale NFTs stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain",
  },
  {
    question: "Why are the whales connected to cryptocurrency?",
    answer: `Many of us got into crypto first and then into NFTs following that, 
      so it's tying the two primary passions together. 
      It also gives holders the opportunity to identify with their favorite 
      coin / token in the form of a whale, which is slang for a large asset holder.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How many attributes will there be?",
    answer: `Whales are procedurally generated from 130+ hand drawn traits resulting 
      in millions of potential unique combinations. 
      Each Whale will represent one of 20 different crypto 
      coins / tokens and their color will correspond with its logo’s colors.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What coins will be represented?",
    answer: `The top 20 coins according to market cap will be represented, excluding 
      stable coins. The snapshot will be taken closer to our drop date`,
  },
  {
    question: "When will the collection be available to mint?",
    answer: `Pre-sale will be Nov. 30th and the public sale will be Dec. 2nd. Exact times announced closer to launch.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What will the price be to mint a whale?",
    answer: `Whales will cost 0.06 ETH to Mint with NO bonding curve or FOMO pricing. 
      Marketplace royalties are 5%.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Where do the secondary royalties go?",
    answer: `60% of all secondary sales collected by Crypto Whale Club will go to the 
      community wallet, 20% will go to a non-profit that the community of whale holders 
      votes on, and 20% will go to the project team.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Will there be a pre-sale?",
    answer: `Yes! Everyone w/the ambassador, referred or whitelist role will have pre-sale 
      access. You can get the role by inviting 10+ people or by being given it from the team 
      for positive contributions to the project (promoting the project w/out spamming, 
      positive discord engagement, retweeting etc).`,
